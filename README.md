#Crowdfunding_ETL

Data Analysis:
The ETL mini-project involved transforming data from multiple Excel files to create structured insights in the form of CSV files for Category, Subcategory, Campaign, and Contacts.
By extracting and transforming data using Python and Pandas, we organized and cleaned the data for analytical purposes.

Learnings:
ETL Process Skills: We developed skills in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, utilizing Python and Pandas for data manipulation and transformation.

Collaboration: The project emphasized teamwork, requiring effective communication for successful completion.

Data Structuring: By creating a comprehensive Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), we gained a deeper understanding of data relationships and structured database schema design.

Database Skills: We enhanced our skills in setting up a PostgreSQL database, creating tables, inserting data, and verifying data integrity through SELECT statements.

Conclusion:
The ETL mini-project provided valuable hands-on experience in extracting, transforming, and loading data efficiently.
By successfully completing the project tasks, we enhanced our data processing skills and developed a better understanding of database management best practices.
Effective collaboration and communication were crucial in ensuring task distribution, progress tracking, and overall project success.
